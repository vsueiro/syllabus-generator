## About the Course

{{course.description}}

### Course Goals

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

- …
- …
- …

### Course Topics

In order to reach the desired goals, students will learn concepts and techniques related to…:

### Course Timeline

We will not learn everything at once. Instead, this course is split into {{course.steps}} steps. Each step builds on top of what we learned from the previous one. Here is what this progression looks like:

![Weekly gantt chart shows weeks class, divided into steps. It resembles 2D platform games by indicading a 🐥 character needs to progress to reach a 🔭 in the end.”](assets/cim643.png)

After a few of weeks of introduction, students begin working on projects (of increasing complexity).

#### Presentation week

At the end of each project step, we have **presentation week** – imagine this to be you a few times during the semester:

![Character with microphone](assets/presentation-week.png)

On presentation week, both classes of that week will be dedicated to presentation and discussion of projects. Half of the students present one day and half on the other. Each student has about 5 minutes to present their project and get feedback.

After the presentation, students are free to adjust the project (based on that feedback) and submit it for grading (prior to the beginning of the first class of the following week).

### Course Content

The following tables briefly describe what we will be doing during class (“Content”) and what you are expected to do before each class (“Preparation”).

## Grading

I reserve the right to adjust the final grade according to class participation, attendance, overall
quality of work, etc.

### Honor Code & Plagiarism Statements

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated.

No honest student wants to be guilty of the intellectual crime of plagiarism, even unintentionally. Therefore, we provide you with these guidelines so that you don’t accidentally fall into the plagiarism trap.

Plagiarism is the taking of someone else’s words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Plagiarism may occur when a person fails to place quotation marks around someone else’s exact words, directly rephrasing or paraphrasing someone else’s words while still following the general form of the original, and/or failing to issue the proper citation to one’s source material.

In student papers, plagiarism is often due to:

- Turning in someone else’s paper as one’s own
- Using another person’s data or ideas without acknowledgment
- Failing to cite a written source (printed or internet) of information that you used to collect data or ideas
- Copying an author’s exact words and putting them in the paper without quotation marks
- Rephrasing an author’s words and failing to cite the source
- Copying, rephrasing, or quoting an author’s exact words and citing a source other than where the material was obtained
- Using wording that is very similar to that of the original source, but passing it off as one’s own

The last item is probably the most common problem in student writing. It is still plagiarism if students use an author’s key phrases or sentences in a way that implies they are their own, even if they cite the source.
